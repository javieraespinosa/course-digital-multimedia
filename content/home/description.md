The consistent integration of multimedia _(text, image, vector forms, animation, audio, video, 3D models)_ assembled in interactive and navigational spaces within applications becomes a recurrent requirement for building digital documents (_Web pages, e-books, blogs, among others_). The evolution of technology and the emergence of a plethora of tools aiming at processing multimedia and building documents makes it difficult to provide simple and efficient documents that provide clear messages and information.
